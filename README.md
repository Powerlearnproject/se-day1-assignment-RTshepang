Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is Writing instructions(code) for computers, buiilding apps, games, and websites that make our lives easier and solving real-world problems through technology.
Importance: reliability,it ensures that it creates software that are easy to use and safe from cyber attacks by implementing authentication, encryption to ensure the safety of the user's information

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Creation of complex but easy to use softwares 
Mastering the creation of machinery

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning- collect the software's requirements 
analysis- gather all the information collected and complete the final decision of the creation of the software
design-build all the work collected
code- build some code that is needed to create a efficient software
test-observe the software or program and check if there any errors,bug or glitches

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall:
Waterfall follows a strict, step-by-step approach. The project progresses through predefined stages and each stage must be completed before moving to the next.
Once a phase is completed, it's difficult to go back and make changes. This makes Waterfall well-suited to projects with clear, unchanging requirements
Since Waterfall is a rigid, linear process, changes to the project scope or requirements can be costly and time-consuming once a phase is completed.
The software or product is typically delivered only after all phases are completed, so the customer may not see a working product until the end.
Agile:
Agile is more flexible and adaptive. It uses iterative cycle(sprints)to develop software incrementally. Each sprint typically lasts 1-4 weeks, and after each sprint, a usable piece of software is delivered.
Agile focuses on collaboration, continuous feedback, and iterative development. Teams can adjust based on feedback, so it’s more adaptable to changes in requirements.
Agile embraces change, allowing teams to adjust project direction based on real-time feedback. The project scope can be adjusted after every sprint.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: writes the code for the software. turn functional specifications and requirements into actual software features. maintain softwares and fix any bugs in the software.
Quality Assurance Engineer: design and execute different levels of testing (unit, integration, system, acceptance) to verify that the application meets its requirements. create detailed test plans and test cases based on requirements or functional specifications. test the software for performance issues
Project Manager: responsible for defining the project scope, creating a roadmap, and setting deadlines. They ensure that the project stays on track and is completed within the agreed-upon time frame. ensure that the product meets the required standards and that all deliverables are completed as expected.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs enhance productivity by providing an all-in-one development environment with features like syntax highlighting, debugging, and easy project navigation.
VCS ensures that developers can collaborate effectively, track changes, and revert to previous versions, making it critical for managing code in both solo and team-based projects

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
software systems grow, the complexity increases, making it harder to maintain, scale, and understand the codebase. This can result in bugs, poor performance, and difficulty in adding new features.Strategies to Overcome: Documenting the Architecture-Maintain clear and updated documentation about the system's architecture and components to provide clarity to the team.Design Patterns-Use well-established design patterns to solve common problems in a structured way and promote code reusability.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing ensures code quality and prevents bugs early.
Integration Testing ensures components work well together.
System Testing validates the entire system for correctness and performance.
Acceptance Testing confirms the software meets user and business requirements, ensuring it’s ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the process where a human gives an AI machine instructions in orde for AI to come up with solutions.
importance: humans receive relevant and true feedback. 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
draw a picture of my family, my dad waering an all black suit with a grey and grey beard. my mom wearing a white dress with braids neatly styled upward.myself with a black dress with a belt with long brazilian hair.
the improved promp is more effective because it delivers what it has been asked better than a human. it gives a clear picture of what is being asked where clear and specific  instructions are given.
